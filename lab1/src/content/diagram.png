PNG

This is a sample diagram image file.
It represents a system architecture diagram.

In a real implementation, this would be a binary PNG file
containing an actual diagram showing:

- Client-Server Architecture
- HTTP Request/Response Flow
- File Serving Process
- Directory Structure

For demonstration purposes, this text file serves as a placeholder
to test the HTTP server's file serving capabilities.
