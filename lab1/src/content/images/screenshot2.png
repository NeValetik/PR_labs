PNG

This is another sample screenshot image file.
It represents a screenshot of the client application.

In a real implementation, this would be a binary PNG file
showing:

- Client command line interface
- File download progress
- Saved files in downloads directory
- HTTP response headers

This file serves as a placeholder for testing the complete
HTTP server and client functionality.
