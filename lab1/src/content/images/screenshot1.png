PNG

This is a sample screenshot image file.
It represents a screenshot of the HTTP server in action.

In a real implementation, this would be a binary PNG file
showing:

- Server console output
- Browser displaying the website
- File directory structure
- Network traffic

This file serves as a placeholder for testing nested directory
serving capabilities of the HTTP server.
