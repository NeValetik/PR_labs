PNG

This is a sample logo image file.
In a real implementation, this would be a binary PNG file.
For demonstration purposes, this is a text representation.

The actual PNG file would contain:
- PNG file signature
- IHDR chunk with image dimensions
- IDAT chunks with compressed image data
- IEND chunk

This file serves as a placeholder for testing the HTTP server's
ability to serve binary files with proper MIME types.
